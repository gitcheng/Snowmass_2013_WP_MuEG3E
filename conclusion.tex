\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

With plausible improvements in photon energy resolution provided by measuring the photon in the decay $\mu \to e \gamma$, time resolution and vertex location, it appears feasible to substantially improve the sensitivity of searches for this decay, provided that a sufficiently intense surface muon beam, such as that being studied in the context of Project~X can be provided. The use of an active target and silicon tracking can similarly improve the sensitivity of searches for the rare decay $\mu \to 3e$.
