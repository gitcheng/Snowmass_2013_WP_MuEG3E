\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

With plausible improvements in photon energy resolution provided by measuring the photon in the decay $\mu \to e \gamma$, time resolution and vertex location, it appears feasible to substantially improve the sensitivity of searches for this decay, provided that a sufficiently intense surface muon beam, such as that being studied in the context of Project~X can be provided. The use of an active target and silicon tracking can similarly improve the sensitivity of searches for the rare decay $\mu \to 3e$.

Improvements in the sensitivity of searches for both $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to 3e$ decays beyond those in proposed in the MEG upgrade and Mu3e experiments are are well-motivated and appear to be quite possible. To achieve this improvement, will be necessary to improve the experimental resolution in the directions explored herein, and to develop a more intense surface muon beam.
