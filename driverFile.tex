\begin{abstract}
Current search for charged lepton flavor violating decay $\mu\to e \gamma$ is 
limited by the accidental background. Future facility such as Project X at 
Fermilab could provide a much more intensive beam but one needs a more 
sensitive detector as well. One of the limiting factors in current detectors
is the photon energy resolution of the calorimeter. We present a study of a
conceptual design of a new detector, using a fast simulation software, that
detects converted $e^+e^-$ pairs from signal photons, taking advantage of a much
better energy resolution of a charged particle tracking device. We also study
a similar design for $\mu\to eee$ ...
